# MachineLearningProject

This project is taking chest xray data classifying if the person has pnemonia or not.
This is useful because we can start to have computers do the classifying which can cutdown
on miss diagnosing patients.

In our project we are using TensorFlow and Keras for the dicom image processing. 

DICOM images are a special type of image used by the medical field that holds more
information than just the image itself (patient name, age, height, weight, etc). 
This data has been stripped of patient data for HIPAA and privacy reasons.

Our data is too large to be uploaded to GitHub, but it can be found at:
